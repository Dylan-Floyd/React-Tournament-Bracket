# React Tournament Bracket

This was a side project I initally started to fill my free time at Alchemy Code Lab.

Now that I'm done with that bootcamp, I'm working on expanding it out to demonstrate
the skills that I've gained.
  
Inspiration: https://challonge.com  
Time invested: ~15 hours  
Tech stack: React, CRA  
Goals: 
- Completed:
  - Figure out how to render a tournament bracket with React.
  - Remove Tailwind.
- Current goal:
  - Add drag and drop to allow users to move winners to the next round.
- Future goals:
  - Improve the way players are entered, make the bracket actually use those players instead of the placeholder data.
  - Add a backend with auth.
  - Implement more tournament systems so the app can handle a number of players that isn't a power of 2.
